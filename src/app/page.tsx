              This is the Onset of something new.<br /><br />
              Join us for a weekend escape in the Berkshires at Camp Timber Trails on September 18â€“20, 2026. At Onset Festival, we're fostering connection and community through music, art, nature, and performance. Our festival is built from the ground up, with the creators being musicians and performers themselves. We aim to provide experiences and activities that bring joy and inspire creativity.

              Spread across more than 400 acres of forest, the venue features a private lake with its own island, beach, and boathouse stocked with kayaks and canoes, a lakeside amphitheatre, beautiful foliage, and stunning views. Set up a tent, or book a cabin, and immerse yourself in a unique experience just a few hours from NYC and Boston.
