              This is the Onset of something new.<br /><br />
              Join us for a weekend escape in the Berkshires at Camp Timber Trails on September 18â€“20, 2026.<br /><br />
              At Onset Festival, we&apos;re fostering connection and community through music, art, nature, and performance. Our festival is built from the ground up, with the creators being musicians and performers themselves. We aim to provide experiences and activities that bring joy and inspire creativity.
